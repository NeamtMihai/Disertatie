The curfew - from 12:00 until 04:00 local time - comes after roads between Port Sudan and the capital Khartoum were blocked. On Tuesday Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok fired Governor Saleh Ammar whose appointment had sparked ethnic protests that prevented him from reporting to work. Several people died in the violence. The prime minister's appointment of civilian governors in all 18 states has sparked ethnic rivalries in some parts of Sudan.Bobi Wine said that documents needed to secure his presidential nomination are missing after a raid.France's Arnaud Demare claims his fourth win of the 2020 Giro d'Italia in a sprint finish on stage 11.Catherine ByaruhangaBBC News, KampalaThe Ugandan politician and musician, Robert Kyagulanyi,\npopularly known as Bobi Wine, has told the BBC that documents needed to secure his\nnomination to run for president are missing from his offices following a raid\nby security forces on Wednesday afternoon. One of the requirements for candidates is to hand in\nsignatures of support from 100 registered voters from at least two-thirds of\nUganda’s districts. Bobi Wine says his team had already collected six million\nsignatures but that these are now missing.“Museveni’s government is trying to block me from nominating as a presidential candidate. From questioning my academic credentials, to questioning my age - now they are making every effort to frustrate my nomination and I want to believe that is why they took the signatures away.” \"We’re not giving up, we have immediately communicated to our branches to ensure they start collecting the signatures immediately and hopefully by Friday we’re going to have the required signatures,” he saidThe MP was speaking to the BBC after fleeing his offices\nwhen dozens of armed soldiers and police arrived to carry out a search.He also said 23\nmillion Ugandan shillings ($6,200; £4,800) were taken. He says this money was raised to\nhelp pay the electoral fees for party members who wish to stand for parliament.The police have not responded to the BBC’s requests for comment on Bobi Wine’s allegations. Earlier they denied that the raid was political.Uganda’s Electoral Commission had given the aspirants an\nadministrative deadline of Friday to hand in the nomination forms. A\nspokesperson for the commission says he can’t comment on Bobi Wine’s alleged\nmissing documents but says the deadline can be extended for candidates if they\nraise the issue with the commission officially.By Frances MaoBBC News, SydneySeven people have been killed by sharks this year - the highest number in more than 90 years.The north-eastern region of Spain joins other parts of Europe where restrictions are being imposed.The US rivals trade accusations as they visit states that may prove pivotal in next month's election.Emery Mwazulu Diyabanza said he went to the Paris museum to claim \"the stolen property of Africa\".Russell PadmoreBusiness correspondent, BBC NewsThe deal to end a long-running dispute between Tanzania and the Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold is\npaying off for the East African country. Twiga Minerals, a joint\nventure between the two, has paid its first dividend, bringing much needed\nrevenue to the nation.Twiga Minerals Corporation, which is a\n50-50 partnership between the Tanzanian government and Barrick Gold has paid a\nmaiden interim cash dividend of $250m (£190m) to its shareholders.Barrick says the pay-out underlines its\ncommitment to generate value for all stakeholders through the partnership.For several years gold production\nsuffered disruption in Tanzania, as the government was at loggerheads with\nAcacia Mining over an unpaid tax bill.Last year, when Barrick took full\ncontrol of Acacia, it set about finding a resolution to the tax dispute, which\nhas reinvigorated gold mining in Tanzania, just as the price of gold surged.Gold is in favour with\ninvestors who are seeking a safe haven, amid the global economic turmoil caused\nby the coronavirus pandemic.Since Barrick took over Acacia Mining’s\nassets in Tanzania last year, it has paid approximately $205m to\nthe government in taxes, royalties and dividends.As heavy fighting continues in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, the BBC reports from both sides.A deal between the neighbours, which are formally at war, would allow them to exploit gas fields.Armen Hagopjanian, an Armenian surgeon in Los Angeles, on what compelled him to returnWill RossAfrica editor, BBC World ServiceThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) says kidnappings in West Africa's Gulf of\nGuinea have risen significantly and now account for almost 95% of\nglobal kidnappings at sea.

In July they attacked a ship almost 200 nautical miles out to sea from Nigeria. The director of the IMB says the\nrisk of violent piracy is adding to the already exceptional stress that crews are under\ndue to the coronavirus pandemic.Read more:A motorcade carrying the king and queen had to push through crowds of pro-democracy protesters.The count is set to end immediately, prompting concerns that minorities will be unaccounted for.The 16-year-old's face and arms were badly mutilated, in an apparent revenge attack.Email us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.ukSend an SMS or MMS to +44 7624 800100Follow Have Your Say on TwitterWhy you can trust BBC News"

This season is not to be missed as it sees the show celebrate a milestone - its 20th Anniversary.With more brand new thrilling and diverse stories, Nikki, Thomas, Jack and Clarissa unite once more against some deadly new enemies.In this series an apparent suicide starts to look a lot more like murder, a young woman is dragged from a river in the same spot where her best friend mysteriously disappeared three years before and, in the final explosive story set in Mexico, Nikki finds herself in danger when she searches for the truth about the death of a former colleague.The award-winning hit comedy is back for its fifth series, about the gloriously idiosyncratic Goodman family and their weekly dinners together.Dad becomes obsessed with his old ventriloquist dummy, Lord Luck, Mum organises her own surprise party, horrible Grandma is back for more horribleness, and the boys, Adam and Jonny, are threatened with no crumble if they don't help to assemble a wooden shelf.Frank Hathaway (Mark Benton) is a down-at-heel private investigator and Luella Shakespeare (Jo Joyner - Eastenders) is his rookie sidekick.Together they form the unlikeliest of partnerships as they investigate the inhabitants of rural Warwickshire and their secrets in this gently comedic drama series.Despite their mutual antipathy, they soon become a formidable team of detectives as they investigate the murdered Mayor of Arden in 'The Chimes at Midnight'. In 'The Promised End' the detectives work against the clock to protect an undertaker when it is discovered that hitmen are making an attempt on his life.This crime fighting duo offer an enjoyably daft take on the much-loved British tradition of the detective series, without the need to put you off your lunch.Aden, 1965.
